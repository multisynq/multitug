# MultiTug

MultiTug is a multiplayer tug-of-war game where players compete to pull a rope to their side, implemented using Croquet running on the MultiSynq DePIN infrastructure.

The whole game code is contained in the `index.html` file, including the multiplayer logic that normally requires server-side code.
